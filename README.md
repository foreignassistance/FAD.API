The Foreign Assistance Dashboard is a key U.S. Government tool to improving the transparency, accessibility, and usefulness of U.S. Government foreign assistance data.  The Dashboard is still in the early stages of development.  It currently contains data from the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. African Development Foundation.  The goal of the Dashboard is to collect detailed data from all agencies implementing or funding foreign assistance.  

 

A first API has been created to improve access to and usefulness of the data.  Feedback from the community is welcome and encouraged in testing, improving, and editing the API. (If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a basic tutorial.)
